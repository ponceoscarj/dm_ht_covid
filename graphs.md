## Data cleaning & Databases information

Data was cleaned via RStudio. All databases are found in the file named
“Databases” located in the github projected called “DM\_HT\_COVID19”.

A total of four databases were used:

1.  **general\_info**: contains ID and real author names with RoB
    results.
2.  **proportions**: contains data needed to perform meta-analysis of
    proportions.
3.  **effectsize**: contains data neded to calculate meta-analysis of
    relative risks.
4.  **unimulti**: contains reported univaraite or multivariate analysis
    of our exposure and outcomes of interest.

## Proportions - summary of forest plots

## Proportions - individual forest plots
